					<p class="row c0c96a6 quote">"John was personal and professional from my initial contact to the final sale of my note. He explained note buying and reinforced certain points of protection for me as the seller. I felt very comfortable in my initial contact after searching online for a note buyer as his web site was direct, clear and understandable. I did review everything John explained and proposed with my own attorney and was advised he was accurate on all counts. John was very thorough and kept me updated as to the process right up to completion. I am very happy with my results and highly recommend John Avenia." - S. Piantedosi, Portland, ME </p>
