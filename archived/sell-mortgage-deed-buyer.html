      <h2 class="text-center new-heading">Learn How to Sell a Mortgage Deed</h2>
      <p class="lead">There are a standard set of procedures to follow when selling a mortgage deed. Here are the essential steps:</p>
      <ol class="lead">
        <li>Determine if there is a need or motivation to sell the mortgage deed. Because private mortgages are sold for less than face value, people selling a mortgage deed should have a reason important to them for selling.</li>
        <li>Research mortgage deed buyers online. There are dozens of mortgage buyers, but only a few are considered the best.</li>
        <li>Request a set of purchase proposals for your mortgage deed from the companies that inspire the most confidence.</li>
        <li>Determine which purchase proposal best meets your needs and select the mortgage deed buyer you’d like to do business with.</li>
        <li>Complete the due diligence necessary to close the sale. You will supply the up-front information and your mortgage deed buyer will complete the rest.</li>
        <li>When the due diligence is complete, a formal title company closing will be scheduled. Closings normally take about 30 minutes and you will leave check in hand.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2 class="text-center new-heading">Facts about Selling a Private Mortgage Deed</h2>
      <p class="lead">Mortgage deed holders who sell their private mortgage achieve numerous benefits. Here are some important facts to consider when deciding whether or not to sell your mortgage deed.</p>
      <ol class="lead">
        <li>With interest rates near all-time lows, there may never be a better time to sell a mortgage deed. You see, the market value of a private mortgage is inversely related to the general interest rate environment. Meaning that as interest rates rise, the market value of private mortgage will fall. If you believe higher interest rates will return, now would be an excellent time to consider selling your mortgage deed.</li>
        <li>The market value of a mortgage deed is defined as the maximum price it will sell for in an active and competitive marketplace. Fortunately, an active and competitive market does exist for privately held mortgage deeds.</li>
        <li>There are several independent variables that factor into determining the market value of a private mortgage deed. Chief among them are the type of collateral property, the amount of owner’s equity in the property, the financial terms of the note and the creditworthiness of the borrower.</li>
        <li>Mortgage deed holders can take steps to ensure they receive the best possible sale price. We recommend doing your homework, contacting more than one mortgage deed buyer and choosing the company you feel most comfortable doing business with.</li>
        <li>We believe in allowing each mortgage holder to decide exactly what the sale of their mortgage deed accomplishes for them. With over 25 years of experience, we can present multiple sale options customized specifically for the mortgage deed holder we are speaking with.</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="lead">Because each mortgage deed holder has a unique decision to make, we invite anyone who holds a private mortgage deed to contact us with their questions. Our <a href="mailto:johnaavenia@gmail.com">President John Avenia</a> (800) 618-2485 and <a href="mailto:hcooper@fairpoint.net">Acquisition Specialist Heidi Cooper</a> (844) 999-9878 are available anytime you would like to talk.</p>

      <h2 class="text-center new-heading">Sale Options Offered by Mortgage Deed Buyers</h2>
      <p class="lead">Most people who search for mortgage deed buyers only think about selling all of their remaining mortgage payments. For many, however, the option of selling just a portion of the remaining payments will provide the best results. Below, we review three of the most popular sale options available.</p>
      <ol class="lead">
        <li>Full Sale: A complete sale of all the remaining mortgage deed payments is the most popular sale option. A full sale of the mortgage provides a number of important benefits, including generating the highest sale price, eliminating the possibility of foreclosure, and completely liquidating the mortgage deed investment.</li>
        <li>Partial Sale: A partial sale of the remaining mortgage deed payments is an excellent option for people who would like to generate a specific amount of cash. Selling a portion of the remaining payments, rather than all of them, allows the mortgage holder to determine exactly how much cash they receive at closing, while also allowing them to retain an investment in the future mortgage payments.</li>
        <li>Split-Payment Partial: A split-payment sale will allow the mortgage holder to sell a portion of each monthly payment and retain the remainder for themselves. This type of sale is excellent for people who want to generate cash, while also maintaining a source of monthly income.</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="lead">We invite you to contact our <a href="mailto:johnaavenia@gmail.com">President John Avenia</a> (800) 618-2485 or <a href="mailto:hcooper@fairpoint.net">Acquisition Specialist Heidi Cooper</a> (844) 999-9878 to discuss the available options when you sell a privately held mortgage deed. You'll have an opportunity to ask questions and learn everything needed to make the decision that's best for you.</p>
