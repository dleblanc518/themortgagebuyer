      <h2 class="text-center new-heading">Facts about Selling a Real Estate Contract</h2>
      <p class="lead">Real estate contract holders who sell their contract achieve numerous benefits. Here are some important facts to consider when deciding whether or not to sell your real estate contract.</p>
      <ol class="lead">
        <li>With interest rates near all-time lows, there may never be a better time to sell a real estate contract. You see, the market value of a real estate contract is inversely related to the general interest rate environment. Meaning that as interest rates rise, the market value of real estate contracts will fall. If you believe higher interest rates will return, now would be an excellent time to consider selling your real estate contract.</li>
        <li>The market value of a real estate contract is defined as the maximum price it will sell for in an active and competitive marketplace. Fortunately, an active and competitive market exists for privately-held real estate contracts.</li>
        <li>There are several independent variables that factor into determining the market value of a real estate contract. Chief among them are the type of collateral property, the amount of owner’s equity in the property, the financial terms of the contract and the creditworthiness of the borrower.</li>
        <li>Real estate contract holders can take steps to ensure they receive the best possible sale price. We recommend doing your homework, contacting more than one real estate contract buyer and choosing the company you feel most comfortable doing business with.</li>
        <li>We believe in allowing each contract holder to decide exactly what the sale of their real estate contract accomplishes for them. With over 25 years of experience, we can present multiple sale options customized specifically for the real estate contract holder we are speaking with.</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="lead">Because each real estate contract holder has a unique decision to make, we invite anyone who holds a real estate contract to contact us. Our <a href="mailto:johnaavenia@gmail.com">President John Avenia</a> (800) 618-2485 and <a href="mailto:hcooper@fairpoint.net">Acquisition Specialist Heidi Cooper</a> (844) 999-9878 are available anytime you would like to talk.</p>

      <h2 class="text-center new-heading">Learn How to Sell a Real Estate Contract</h2>
      <p class="lead">There are a standard set of procedures to follow when selling a real estate contract. Here are the essential steps:</p>
      <ol class="lead">
        <li>Determine if there is a need or motivation to sell the real estate contract. Because private contracts are sold for less than face value, people selling a real estate contract should have a reason important to them for selling.</li>
        <li>Research real estate contract buyers online. There are dozens of contract buyers, but only a few are considered the best.</li>
        <li>Request a set of purchase proposals for your real estate contract from the companies that inspire the most confidence.</li>
        <li>Determine which purchase proposal best meets your needs and select the real estate contract buyer you’d like to do business with.</li>
        <li>Complete the due diligence necessary to close the sale. You will supply the up-front information and your real estate contract buyer will complete the rest.</li>
        <li>When the due diligence is complete, a formal title company closing will be scheduled. Closings normally take about 30 minutes and you will leave check in hand.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2 class="text-center new-heading">Sale Options Offered by Real Estate Contract Buyers</h2>
      <p class="lead">Most people who search for real estate contract buyers only think about selling all of their remaining contract payments. For many, however, the option of selling just a portion of the remaining payments will provide the best results. Below, we review three of the most popular sale options available.</p>
      <ol class="lead">
        <li>Full Sale: A full sale of all the remaining real estate contract payments is the most popular sale option. A complete sale of the contract provides a number of important benefits, including generating the highest sale price, eliminating the possibility of foreclosure, and completely liquidating the real estate contract investment.</li>
        <li>Partial Sale: A partial sale of the remaining real estate contract payments is an excellent option for people who would like to generate a specific amount of cash. Selling a portion of the remaining payments, rather than all of them, allows the contract holder to determine exactly how much cash they receive at closing, while also allowing them to retain an investment in the future contract payments.</li>
        <li>Split-Payment Partial: A split-payment sale will allow the contract holder to sell a portion of each monthly payment and retain the remainder for themselves. This type of sale is excellent for people who want to generate cash, while also maintaining a source of monthly income.</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="lead">We invite you to contact our <a href="mailto:johnaavenia@gmail.com">President John Avenia</a> (800) 618-2485 or <a href="mailto:hcooper@fairpoint.net">Acquisition Specialist Heidi Cooper</a> (844) 999-9878 to discuss the available options when you sell a real estate contract. You'll have an opportunity to ask your questions and learn everything needed to make the decision that's best for you.</p>
